# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Library**: Migrate `spotify_save_tracks`, `spotify_remove_saved_tracks`, `spotify_save_albums`, `spotify_remove_saved_albums` to Spotify's unified `PUT`/`DELETE /v1/me/library?uris=...` endpoint. The previous `/v1/me/tracks` and `/v1/me/albums` endpoints were deprecated in February 2026 and now return silent 403s. Tool input schemas are unchanged (still bare ID arrays); the URI prefix mapping happens internally. Batch size limit drops from 50 to 40 IDs per call per Spotify's new limit. Includes a one-shot token refresh + retry on 401.

### Tests
- Replace wrapper-based mocks for save/remove with global `fetch` mocks; add 401-refresh-retry test and batch-size guard test for `saveTracks`

### Removed
- Drop `addToMySavedTracks`, `removeFromMySavedTracks`, `addToMySavedAlbums`, `removeFromMySavedAlbums` from the internal `SpotifyClient` interface. These targeted endpoints Spotify deprecated in February 2026 and are no longer called anywhere in the codebase.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Security**: Set `.env` file permissions to `0600` (owner-only read/write) in setup wizard, preventing other local users from reading `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- **Security**: Broaden `redactSensitiveData()` string heuristic regex to match JWT and Base64 token formats (tokens containing `.`, `+`, `/`, `=`)

### Tests
- Add test for `.env` secure file permissions in setup wizard

- **Resilience**: Graceful recovery from corrupted `tokens.json` — deletes bad file and re-triggers OAuth instead of crashing
- **Resilience**: Token refresh failures now delete stale tokens and throw a user-friendly "Session expired" message
- **Types**: Add `SpotifyClient` interface covering all 30+ API methods used across the codebase
- **Types**: Type `getAuthenticatedClient()` return as `Promise<SpotifyClient>` instead of implicit `any`
